     * [com.gravitycode.simpletracker.workout_list.WorkoutListComponent]? Can I share [ApplicationComponent]
     * as a parent to all the feature components, e.g. [com.gravitycode.simpletracker.workout_list.WorkoutListComponent]?
     *
     * Subcomponents are components that inherit and extend the object graph of a parent component.
     * You can use them to partition your applicationâ€™s object graph into subgraphs either to
     * encapsulate different parts of your application from each other or to use more than one scope
     * within a component.
     *
     * But the application context from [ApplicationComponent] gets injected into
     * [com.gravitycode.simpletracker.workout_list.WorkoutListComponent] without any problems?
     * So what exactly does a subcomponent actually do?
